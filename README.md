# CarVisualization

An attempt at simple exploratory data analysis to familiarize myself with seaborn. The observations made were using the US car dataset taken from [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/doaaalsenani/usa-cers-dataset)

Questions I wanted to answer are listed below

1. Which Brand sells the most?
2. Which Color is the most popular?
3. Which model year is most popular?
4. Which brand is the most expensive?
5. Which states buy the most cars?
6. Out of the top 5 buying states, which brands do they buy?

According to my fidnings, Ford was the most popular brand followed by Dodge, with white being the most popular color. Most cars were from the year 2019, Harley Davidson was the most expensive and the state of Pennsylvania bought the most cars.

This data has also been visualized using Tableau and can be seen [here.](https://public.tableau.com/views/RankingUSCarSales/PurchasingStates?:language=en-GB&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link)
